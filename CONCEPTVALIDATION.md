# Introduction:

_"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I’m working on a project called Mic Runner,
which aims to improve the way audience members interact during large events. Right now,
passing around a microphone or relying on a few stationary mics can be inefficient and limit
participation. We’re exploring a solution that allows audience members to use their own
smartphones as microphones, transmitting their voice directly to the room’s speakers."_

## How It Works:

_"Imagine this: Instead of waiting for a mic to be passed around, attendees scan a QR code or
enter a room PIN on their phone. When they’re ready to speak, they simply tap a button, and
their voice is streamed live to the presentation audio system. The system would include built-in
feedback prevention and echo cancellation to ensure clear audio."_

## Key Features:

● **Real-Time Audio Broadcasting** – Audience members speak directly from their
smartphones to the room’s speakers.
● **Push-to-Talk System** – Users must hold a button to speak, preventing unnecessary
background noise.
● **Moderator Controls** – The presenter or event organizer can mute/unmute participants,
queue speakers, and manage audience input.
● **Low-Latency Communication** – Exploring WebRTC or local networking options to
minimize audio delay.

## Why We’re Here:

_"We’re still in the concept validation stage and want to make sure we’re solving a real problem.
Since you regularly lead events where audience participation is important, we’d love to hear
your thoughts. Does this sound like something that would be useful for your events? What
challenges do you see with this type of system?"_

## Call to Action:

_"Your feedback will help us refine the design and prioritize key features. We’d really appreciate
your thoughts on how this could fit into your workflow and any concerns you might have."_
Questions:
Understanding Current System
● Can you describe how audience members currently ask questions during your events?
● What are some challenges or frustrations with this setup?
● Have you ever considered alternative ways to manage Q&A sessions?
● How often do technical issues (e.g., microphone failures, poor audio quality) impact your
events?

# Introducing the Concept

● Explain MicRunner
Evaluating Features and User Needs
● Would a **push-to-talk** feature (where audience members must hold a button to speak)
be necessary?
● Would you find it helpful if a moderator could **control who speaks** and **mute/unmute
participants**?
● Would you prefer a **queue system** where people "raise their hand" and speak in turn?
● How important is **audio quality** to you? What level of clarity would you expect?
Adoption and Feasability
● How easy or difficult would it be to get your audience to adopt this kind of system?
● Would a **QR code or room PIN** system be an effective way for attendees to connect?
● What kind of **technical support** would you need to feel comfortable using this system?
● Would you be more likely to try this if it were a **standalone app** or a **web-based
solution**?
Concerns
● Do you have any concerns about **audio feedback or latency** affecting the experience?
● How important is it that the system works **offline or on a local network** rather than
relying on the internet?
● Are there any accessibility concerns you’d want us to consider?

# Bishop Wagner 163 Ward:

Understanding Current System
● Currently we have people raise their hands and either they speak loudly or a designated
person will run the microphone to them.
● There can be a delay between the microphone getting to people or people not being
able to hear the questions.
● I haven’t thought about it
● Not extremely often but he has been in a church devotional that was inturrupted by
technical difficulties.
Evaluating Features and User Needs
● He likes the idea of allowing participants to push to talk but also controls for the
presenter if things get out of hand.
● He thinks the idea of people entering a queue from their phone and seeing that on the
presenters end is efficient and less distracting with people not having to raise their
hands.
● Just concerned about audio feedback
Adoption and Feasability

● Slightly concerned with the contradiction of having asked people not to use their phones
in meetings.
● Yes!
● Someone near the stand to control the presenter side from a laptop or minor training on
his end to see from the pulpit.
● Web based
Concerns
● He isn’t concerned about relying on the internet because most places devotionals
happen people are connected to school or church wifi.
● People who don’t have a phone and still want to ask questions.
