## Running and building locally

`npm run build`
`npm run start` or `npm start`

## Deploying 

`npm run deploy`

## Testing

You can use the deployed link for both peers; however, it's probably harder to debug and a slower process that requires frequent deployment. Recommended to use the deployed link as a static peer and test changes with a local build before deploying to production.
